                </Typography>

                <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace"}}>The Lineup Details section can be seen in the Lineups Page after you click on any lineup. A pop-up will then appear, giving a complete
                  breakdown of each submitted entry. The number of picks, your Over or Under pick, entry amount, potential payout along with the multipliers, and a live status of each player will be shown with our 
                  visual progress bar! The progress bar will show how close the player is to their projected line, and the status of each player will be shown as either <strong>In Progress</strong> (white), <strong>Won</strong> (green), 
                  or <strong>Lost</strong> (red). If the player does not play <strong>(DNP)</strong>(DNP), then they will be grayed out and the multiplier will be fluxuated down by one size or however much players DNP. This essentially means
                  that the entry will continue and pay out as if that player was never picked. (Example, 6-Pick lineup will act as a 5-leg). However, if it results to one or less players left, then the entry will be refunded.</Typography>

                  <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace", marginBottom: "1rem"}}>A: Each lineup must include between 2 to 6 players. They also cannot all be from the same team! This helps with increasing the competitive and diverse aspect of PlayBook.</Typography>
                  <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: "bold"}}>Q: What is the main difference between Flex Play and Power Play?</Typography>
                  <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace", marginBottom: "1rem"}}>A: Essentially, Flex Play allows for some margin of error, meaning that you can still win with partial payouts even if you dont hit all of your lines. However, Power Play requires all of your picks
                    to hit, but offers a higher payout multiplier in return! Go big or go home!</Typography>

                  <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace", marginBottom: "1rem"}}>A: You can find active promotions under our Promotions Tab on the top right corner of the navigation menu. New promos are added every so often so remember to check frequently as they might expire!</Typography>
                  <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: "bold"}}>Q: What are promo funds and what can I do with them?</Typography>
                  <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace", marginBottom: "1rem"}}>A: Promo funds are essentially an in-game currency that can be only used in the app. It cannot be withdrawn, but acts like your real balance in the app. If used and won, it will be translated into real
                    currency that you can withdrawl! If you use promo funds and lose an entry, don't worry! Nothing will actually be deducted from your balance. </Typography>
                  <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace", fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: "bold"}}>Q: How can I add more money to my balance?</Typography>
                  <Typography sx={{fontFamily: "monospace", marginBottom: "1rem"}}>A: To add more money to your balance, simply head to the Funds page located in the top right of the navigation board, click on the deposit option, select the amount of money you want to withdrawal, select a card 
                    (remember to add your card first!), enter the card's CVV, and click on the Confirm button to confirm the deposit. Good luck!</Typography>
